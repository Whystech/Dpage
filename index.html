      <p>Motor oil is one of the most important elements within a combustion engine. A well-maintained machine is a machine that has good quality oil, serviced at the proper time. But what does the motor oil actually do within an engine? </p>
      <p>One of the most important tasks of the engine oil is to reduce friction between the moving parts of an engine. Oil creats a thin film that does not allow metal on metal contact. This film allows for the parts to not damage each other as well as dissipate the heat. For example, it protects pistons and cylinders from damaging each other during the cylinder stroke cycle. </p>

      <p>Engine oil is a petroleum product composed from hydrocarbons and polyalphaolefins. </p>
       <br>
      <code>
        <p> The chemical formula for engine oil is: C8H18</p></code>
         <br>
      <p> American John Ellis founded the Continuous Oil Refining Company (aka:<i>Valvoline</i>) on September 6 1866.</p>
      <p>Dr. Elis was researching the potential medicinal uses of the crude oil. Whule he discovered no potential use in medicine, he noticed the lubricating properties the oil had.</p>
      <p>Soon, he was able to use his oil as lubricant for steam engines which used other highly inefficient lubricants such as animal and vegetable oil as well as other inefficient petroleum mixtures.</p>

      <section class='main-section' id='Viscosity'><header><h1>Viscosity</h1></header>
      <p>Viscosity is  the most important properties of the motor oil.</p>
      <p>In simple terms, viscosity shows us how <b>thick</b> an oil is as well as <b>how fast it thins or thickens</b> at different temperatures </p>
      <p>For example a 5W-30 oil viscosity, one of the most common viscosity levels used on cars, tells us that the oil thins out faster at higher temperatures. </p>
      <br>
      <code id='vscno'>
        <p>Common oil viscosity classification: <p>
        <p>“XW-XX”</p>
        <ul>
        <li>XW - viscosity at zero degrees Fahrenheit <br>("W" stands for "W"inter)</li>
        <br>
        <li>XX - resistance to thinning at 100 degrees Celsius
          <br>
          (Higher XX means higher resistance to thinning)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class='exf'>Example:</li>
        <li class='ex'>5W-30  thickens less in cold weather compared to 10W-30</li>
        <li class='ex'>5W-30 thins out more quickly at high temperatures compared to 5W-40</li>
      </ul></code>
       <br>
      <p>Why is this important?</p>
      <p>As engine heats up, the oil film needs to be strong enough in order to keep parts from wearing themselves out, hence the need for resistance to thinning.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, an oil with an XW value (resistance to thickening during winter) too low for the climate the engine is used in will result in poor performance, and increased wear due to the extra effort put by the engine in order to move the thick oil.
      
      <p>Depending on climate and driving style, oils should be applied accordingly. </p>
      <p>Eg. 5W-30 will give better fuel consumption within normal use, but 5W-40 will perform better and lubricate deeper at high temperatures.</p>
        <br>
      <code><p>High performance racing cars use exotic oil viscosities such as 10W-60 for better performance at very high temperatures.</p></code>

      <section class='main-section' id='Types_of_oil'><header><h1>Types of oil</h1></header>
      <p>Besides viscosity, engine oil can also be segmented in four different varieties.</p>
      <h4>Syntehtic oil</h4>
      <p>Synthetic oil is product of chemically modified petroleum products. Depending on the brand several additives and other chemicals are added in order to obtain the best mixture. </p>
      <p>Compared to the conventional engine oil, syhnthetic oil has better low and high temperature performance. However, older engines that are not designed for synthetic oil should use conventional oil or the recommended oil type.</p>
      <h4>Synthetic Blend Motor Oil</h4>
      <p>As the name suggests, synthetic blend is a combination of conventional oil and synthetic oil. Compared to the conventional oil it performs better at low temperatures and has better oxidation protection.</p>
      <h4>High Mileage Motor Oil</h4>
      <p>High mileage motor oil is a specially formulated type of oil that is designed for older engines (or new engines that surpassed  75.000 miles) and has properties that make it less prone to burn and seal leaks. </p>
      <br>
       <code><p>Different types of oil should not be mixed, as a lower quality type of oil will decrease the quality of the higher one. However, if it is necessary, one can top off already present synthethic with conventional rather than running the engine dry. </p></code>
       <br>
      <h4>Conventional Oil</h4>
      <p>Conventional oil is a less engineered type of motor oil. It has less additives and, as a consequence, it is cheaper. </p>
      <p>Conventional oil does not manage well at low or high temperatures and has an overall lower performance compared to its counterparts and is therefore recommended for casual drive styles and normal use. </p>

      <section class='main-section' id='Oil_Degradation'><header><h1>Oil Degradation</h1></header>
     
      <p>Much like all things, even motor oil lifespan is limited.</p>
      <h4>Moisture Degradation</h4>
      <p>Oil can suffer degradation because of moisture present within the engine.The engine heats the moisture which reacts with the oil allowing it to burn up. Aditionally, while oil is molecullary lighter than water, over time oil can absorb moisture and lose some of its lubrication properties. An engine that is used regulary will have less moisture built within it.
        <b>A healthy engine, is an active engine.</b>
        <p>Water infiltration within the engine can also degrade oil.</p>
        <h4>Thermal breakdown</h4>
      <p>Oil can also be degraded because of thermal breakdown. As mentioend above, oil can perform well within a set temperature level. If the temperature is too high above its stable temperature, oil will start to break down and again, start to lose its temperature. Oil will face temperatures that are 'too high' so thermal breakown is unavoidable, however, all the high temperatures that would strain the engine parts will instead damage the oil, keeping the engine healthy.</p>
      <h4>Additive Depletion</h4>
      <p>Additives work as over-time protectors of the oil.</p>
      <p>Additives make the oil functional and protect its properties. Additives are sacrificial, they brake down chemically over time and during use.</p>
      <p>Additives determine the life of the oil, it is also the reason why the oil has a shelf-life of 5 years. While oil does not degrade overtime if kept in a sealed container, additives within the oil will do.</p>
      <br> 
      <code><p>Additives have three basic roles</p>
       <ul>
         <li id='addtv'>>Enhance existing base oil properties</li>
         <li id='addtv'>>Suppress undesirable base oil properties</li>
         <li id='addtv'>>Impart new properties to base oils</li>
         </ul></code>
         <br>
      <h4>Contamination</h4>
      <p>As mentioned above, water can greatly affect oil performance and degradation speed.</p>
      <p>However, oxygen can also oxidize the oil. Fine metal parts and dirt can also chemically react with the oil, accelerating the degradation process. </p>

      <hr>
      <section class='main-section' id='Filters'><header><h1>Filters</h1></header>
      <p>While an engine works under high physical loads and temperatures, the inside parts need to be protected as much as possible from outside contaminants and other elements that could damage the parts.</p>
      <p>During combustion, multiple waste particles are generated: dirt, sand or otjer particles as a result from burning fuel. Also, even if the engine is healthy, small metal particles can still shave during the combustion process. Ultimately, these conaminants reach the oil.  </p>
      <p>This is where the oil fiter comes in. The filter basically holds off all these impurities and particles within a cone made from multiple paper sheets, keeping them away from reaching the engine. </p>
      <h4>Filter life</h4>  
      <p>Filters need to be changed before they are full of impurities. Using an overused oil filter can lead to poor performance, a decreased fuel economy performance and possible overtime damage to the engine.</p>
      <p>By not changing a used filter in a timely manner it can clog up and allow your engine to run dry with no oil, leading to terminal damage. Some premium oil filters contain a bypass valve, which in a situation that the filter becomes clogged, it opens up and allows oil to reach the engine (albeit dirty oil).</p>
      <p>Most mechanics and dealerships recommend oil filters to be changed at 10.000km or with each oil change for best practice - although it is not critical to do so.</p>
      <p>The best idea is to verify the manual for each engine to verify what are the recommended hours of use or kilometers driven at which an oil filter change should occur.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <section class='main-section' id='Oil_Changes'><header><h1>Oil Changes</h1></header>
      <p>Same as filters, oil should be changed when the additives within have been burned out or when the lubrication qalities have worn out.</p>
      <p>Depending on the use, oil can be used only for a cartain amount of time. If the mileage or the recommended hours of use have been reached, oil should be changed no matter "how long" has it been within the engine. </p>
      <p>Also, oil should not be used within an engine for more than one year.</p>
      <br>
      <code><p id="or">As a rule of thumb, oil should be changed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class='ex'>Every 10.000km</li>
          <p id="or">OR</p>
          <li class='ex'>Every 12 months</li>
        </ul>
      <p id="or">Whichever comes first.</p>

      <p>Please keep in mind the following rules in order to avoid damages and possible injuries that may occur during handling engine oil:
        <ul>
          <li class="rules">Always change oil after the engine has cooled down. After a long drive wait <b>at least 30 minutes</b> before iniating an oil change.</li>
          <li class="rules">Cover the place where you intend to change the oil in order to protect the surrounding area.</li>
          <li class="rules">Use gloves.</li>
          <li class="rules">Dispose of used oil and oil filters <b>ONLY</b> at designated recycle facilities. Oil spills are are serious environmental issue.</li>
          <li class="rules">Only use the oil recommened by the engine manufacturer. If planning to use a different oil for a special circumstance, do your research before.</li>
          <li class="rules">If an oil change requires going under a vehicle that requires to be seated on jack-stands, be sure that the vehicle is very stable to avoid fatal injuries.</li>
